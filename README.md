# Collabor8-CartPole
A deep Q-network solution of the CartPole problem, prepared for the Collabor8.1 conference.

This project requires Python 3 and Tensorflow to work. It provides a framework for solving reinforcement learning problems using deep Q-networks. As of 09/02/17 the implementation is incomplete.

The code is shamelessly based on other web resources - citations to follow.
